## Hi there 👋
Hi, I’m Angelo! 👋

At age 3, I learned chess on my own. By age 9, I was a City-wide Champion.

At age 13, I picked up a Rubik's cube. Two weeks later, I was solving it in under 30 seconds.

These aren't just fun facts. They are proof that I love deconstructing complex systems and have a relentless drive to master them. Today, I channel that energy into Data Engineering.

As a Registered Medical Technologist (RMT) in the Philippines, I have a unique advantage: I don't just see raw data; I understand the clinical reality behind it. I bridge the gap between healthcare operations and technical infrastructure, building pipelines that drive smarter decisions.

When I’m not engineering data:

→ 📺 Anime
